# collaborative-code-editor

Collaborative Ace Editor example with selection synchronization, active user display, and real time text collaboration using ShareDB. The purpose of this repo is to give a basic example setup for ShareDB with Ace

## Details

Uses `ot-text` as an example format, but could easily be updated to use `ot-text-tp2` or other OT formats

Because ShareDB requires precompiling source to load, a pre-built version of sharedb is copied from [this repo](https://github.com/gkjohnson/sharedb-builds)
